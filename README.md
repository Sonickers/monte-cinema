# üçø MONTE CINEMA API üé•

### Technologies
- Rails 6
- Ruby 3.0
- Postgresql
- RSpec

### Must have
Functional requirements:
- [x] Endpoint to buy tickets/create reservation from ticket desk
- [x] Endpoint to buy tickets/create reservation from online application
- [x] There should be mechanism (Cronjob? Background job?) to terminate reservation if somebody did not pay ~30 minutes before screening (for reservations created by online application)
There should be email communication provided:
- [ ] When reservation is created (tickets, seats and price should be attached)
- [ ] When reservation is terminated (the reason should be attached)
- [x] Creating reservation should be robust and there should be validations (for instance - for already taken seats etc., - consider edge cases). 
- [x] Application should have implemented authentication (there should be logging by user and by employer)
- [x] Application should have authorization in terms of role-based separation
- [x] Regular user should have ability to create only online reservation
- [x] Employer should have ability to create online reservation but also offline reservation

Not functional requirements:
- [ ] API should be documented 
- [x] Application should have provided seeds and should be generally operational
- [x] At least 80% of tests coverage
- [ ] Application should have connected Sentry and CircleCI
- [ ] Application should be accessible publicly (for instance by Heroku)
- [x] Application should have configured rubocop and should fulfill all rubocop requirements.

Nice to have:
- [ ] JSON:API endpoint
- [ ] GraphQL endpoint
- [ ] File upload (for instance avatar for user?)
- [ ] Other functionalities like adding new movies, screenings, cinema halls
